Report

The assignment which I chose was about fitness, unlike other projects the fitness was neither difficult nor easy and there were a  lot of problems that I had to solve. For Html, there are a total of six pages, three js, and for  CSS I created a separate folder which contains five CSS. Also, there is another folder for images. As for the project itself, the home page was created first so I could link other pages. Inside the Html page, there are several div classes and ids, and all of them are put in the right order with the headers and sections included. Moreover, in order to not be confused inside the Html pages as well as CSS, there are some comments, where  I put them to identify where footers,  contacts, and images are located. As for the problems which I faced  I validated both Html and CSS, but there were tons of problems related to images and scripts so it took me some time to fix the problems. Furthermore, in the project, javascript has been included in the contact Html page, where the given value will be shown. Moving to the next page is, About so here page in terms of design and coding part is almost the same as with Home page. There are also pages like price and schedule where clients can view the timetable and see how much courses cost per month. As for the purpose of choosing fitness, joining an engaging community is presently one of the top reasons people go to the gym, and developing a fitness website is a crucial way to contribute to that community and starting a website not only improves the consumer experience but also helps people advertise the business and keep organized. Members will visit the My gym website to examine the exercise class schedule, make a reservation, and learn about the services the website provides.
